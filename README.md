# Introduction
Welcome to the landing page for the *R for Health Data Science* or *R4HDS* seminar series, organized be Health Data Nova Scotia (HDNS).  Throughout this course we will be exploring how R can be used within Epidemiology and more generally in health research, with a focus on usage within the analysis of secondary data.

All course content is listed above, and the accompanying lectures are available on YouTube ([playlist is here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJO16lSgnGtgA276LxzOKIG_YXY7s4lRc)).  Note that each class will have breakout sessions that are not recorded, so even with the recordings you will be missing some content if you miss the classes.

Each session will be 90 minutes (Fridays, 9:30-11:00).  We will start with 45 minutes of lecture and programming, then split into small groups for 30 minutes, then come back and discuss for the final 15.  The 10 classes will roughly follow the following schedule:

1. Intro to R
2. Data manipulation
3. Graphics
4. Biostats 1 (hypothesis tests and regression)
5. Reporting
6. Tidyverse - dplyr
7. Tidyverse - ggplot2
8. Biostats 2 - survival and mixed effects
9. Biostats 3 - gee
10. Non-standard data structures - XML and JSON
